                <h1>Manifesto</h1>
                <p>Hacking has evolved far past its intended end date. The ASU Hacking Club has, in response, decided to
                    go
                    back. Back to a time when hacking was simpler. We now dedicate our time to teaching other hackers
                    about
                    how to hack like it was the 90’s and slowly progress towards the present.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We believe that a good hacker comes through practice, dedication, and above all else, curiosity.
                    Through
                    our efforts we hope to make those who seek to be L33T the best they can possibly be. The content in
                    this
                    club is in no way easy, but we hope to make it easier with our guidance.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Lastly, the goal of this club is to turn white belt hackers into black belts, with the help of leet
                    members of Shellphish and through <a href="https://cct.edu.np/"
                        style="background: #898989; color: black; font-weight: 900;text-decoration: none;">CCT.college</a>.

                <p>For 2022 Fall Semester, we have a meeting every Friday at 3pm-5pm AZ Time, online through our

                <h2>Faculty Advisors</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The faculty leaders of the ASU Hacking Team are highly intertwined with the Shellphish CTFing team.
                    Those
                    individuals are:</p>
                <br>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li>dam Doupe, Associate Professor (@adamd)</li>
                    <li>Yan Shoshitaishvili, Assistant Professor (@zardus)</li>
                    <li>Fish Wang, Assistant Professor (@fish)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Two of the three were previous <a href=""
                        style="background: #838383; color: black; font-weight: 900; text-decoration: none;"> OOO </a> organizers who ran what
                    is known as the Hacker Olympics (DEF CON CTF
                    Finals). One of the three is known as the best reverse engineer in Shellphish. Indeed, we could not
                    have
                    a more leet set of advisors.</p>

                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>Originally, this club went by the name of <span><button style="background-color: #c6c6c6;"><a href=""
                                style="color: black; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none;">pwndevils</a></button></span>,
                    which was started in 2009 to play CTFs. The
                    pwndevils competed in CTFs very actively between 2015 and 2020, culminating in its brief time as the
                    10th ranked hacking team in the world by <span><button style="background-color: #c6c6c6;"><a href=""
                                style="color: black; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none;">CTFTime</a></button></span>.
                    After ranking top 10, the pwndevils merged with an
                    already present Shellphish, the oldest hacking team in the United States. Since its advisors were
                    also from <span><button style="background-color: #c6c6c6;"><a href=""
                                style="color: black; font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none;">Shellphish</a></button></span>,
                    this was the great continuation of the Shellphish legacy.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The pwndevils club continued to exist internally at ASU until its name/brand change in 2021,
                    resulting in the now known ASU Hacking Club. The ASU Hacking Club was formed to fill the gap between
                    playing CTFs competitively and recruiting Undergraduate students, which often look for a more
                    beginner and social experience. For more info on the pwndevils history, see the pwndevils
                    <span><button style="background-color: #c6c6c6;"><a href=""

                <br>
                <p>Currently, the club strives towards getting competitive hackers that will join the Shellphish CTF
                    team on its international conquest to be the best hacking team.</p>
